# Quick Replies

## Intro

These are not mentioned explicitly in the learning outcomes, but, they are
covered in detail by the MS course.

Quick replies can be used by agents to send predefined messages to customers and
may be personalised with slugs.

Administrators can create quick replies available to all agents. Agents may also
create their own quick replies for their own use.

## Create a Quick Reply as an Administrator (Activity)

1. Navigate to Admin Center -> Productivity -> Quick Replies
2. Select New to access the Quick Reply Form
3. Enter a title, e.g. {your initials} Introduction Unauthenticated User
4. Choose the locale

### Tags

Tags are used when searching for a quick reply. They can also be used to easily
group quick replies.

5. Enter tags, e.g. Greeting, Introduction, {your name}

As you start typing, a list of tags already used will be displayed that you may
choose from. If no tags exit just blur the input and they should be added.

This helps to keep tags organised while providing a simple interface that may
be used by both agents and administrators.

### Slugs

When you write a message you can also use slugs from the Dynamic Text section.

6. Enter a short message using slugs, e.g. Hello, I am {FirstName{Agent}} and
   will assist you today. Please tell me your full name.
7. Save the quick reply

## Using Quick Replies (Activity)

By default quick replies are available throughout the organisation.

We can limit quick replies to specific workstreams by associating a quick reply
with one or more workstreams:

1. Navigate to Admin Center -> Workstreams
2. Select the chat workstream used in the notification section
3. In advanced settings, add your quick reply to the workstream

**If you have set-up a test page with a chat widget**

4. Send a message with the chat widget
5. Select the quick reply button in the workspace chat or type /q followed by a
   space
6. Find and send your custom message

## Creating Personal Quick Replies as an Agent (Activity)

As mentioned, agents can create their own quick replies. These are accessible
only to the agent creating the reply but they may be shared.

1. Navigate to Customer Service Workspace
2. From the site map, select Personalisation
3. Select New Personal quick reply from the command bar
4. Type a message and save
5. Add a tag, e.g. greeting or introduction
