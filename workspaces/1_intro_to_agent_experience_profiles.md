# Introduction to Agent Experience Profiles

## Introduction

Workspaces allow us to create customised environments for different users
without having to build custom apps. The mechanism used to achieve this
customisation is **Agent Experience Profiles**.

When defining Agent Experience Profiles, we will use various components
including:

- Business processes
- Workstreams
- Queues
- Session Templates
- Macros
- Agent scripts

**Note**: Agent Experience profiles are not available for users in Customer
Service Hub.

## Default Profiles

Out of the box, there are a number of default profiles available. It is not
possible to modify these profiles (indicated by the locked padlock option).

## Creating an Agent Experience Profile

To create an Agent Experience Profile, navigate to:

Admin Center -> Workspaces

Most of the configuration options for this section can be found in this page.

### Creating a Custom Agent Experience Profile

#### Create a Basic Profile (Activity)

1. Navigate to Agent Center -> Workspaces
2. Select Manage next to Agent Experience Profiles
3. Select New
4. Enter a name: {your initials} Demo Profile
5. Enter a unique name {your initials}\_demoProfile
6. Optionally, enter a short description

Once the record is saved we need to add ourselves to the profile. We can only
belong to one profile at a time:

1. Find the profile you are currently associated with, e.g. Customer Service
   Trial Profile
2. Select edit on the users section of that profile
3. Remove yourself as a user
4. Go to your custom profile and select Add users
5. Search for your user record and select it by clicking to the left of your
   name
6. Click add
