# Other Agent Experience Profile Settings

## Intro

There are a number of settings available in the Agent Experience Profile form
that are not explicitly stated in the learning outcomes:

## Channel Providers

This is skimmed over in the materials. There is a toggle to enable or disable
all active channels.

There is also the possiblitity to add a third-party voice channel provider. I
think/hope this is out of the scope of the exam.

## Copilot AI Features

These should be covered in the section on copilot. The only thing of relevance
to the current section, is the suggested actions inbox view. As mentioned, this
view is readonly and must be enabled/disabled from the AI Features panel.
