# Introduction to Agent Experience Profiles

## Introduction

Workspaces allow us to create customised environments for different users
without having to build custom apps. The mechanism used to achieve this
customisation is **Agent Experience Profiles**.

For both the workspaces and productivity sections, most of the functionality is
enabled using Agent Experience Profiles.

In this first section you will create a basic Agent Experience Profile. As the
course progresses you will add features to this profile.

**Note**: Agent Experience profiles are not available for users in Customer
Service Hub.

## Default Profiles

Out of the box, there are a number of default profiles available. It is not
possible to modify these profiles (indicated by the locked padlock option).

## Creating an Agent Experience Profile

To create an Agent Experience Profile, navigate to:

Admin Center -> Workspaces

Most of the configuration options for this section can be found in this page.
