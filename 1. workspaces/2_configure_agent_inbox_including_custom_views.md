# Configure Agent Inbox

## Introduction

The inbox is a centralised hub allowing agents to view their workload, at a
glance, across different workstreams.

## Explore Inbox (Activity)

1. Navigate to your custom Agent Experience Profile
2. You should see a list of inbox views
3. Navigate to Workspaces and open the inbox
4. There should be a panel showing an inbox view
5. Select the list icon next to the name of the current view
6. This will show a list of all available inbox views

### Suggested Actions View

The suggested actions view may not be visible. This is a readonly view. To
activate or deactivate this view you need to select the relevant setting from
the Copilot AI Features section of the Agent Experience Profile form.

### Creating a Custom Inbox View (Activity)

We are going to create a custom inbox view that will list all high-priority
cases.

1. Create a new case with the priority set to high
2. In your Agent Experience Profile, select edit in the Inbox section
3. Select Add
4. Give a descriptive name, e.g. High Priority Cases
5. Select case and email as the record types
6. Select advanced settings for both and add a condition that the priority is
   high, this condition acts as a filter
7. Add a custom sort for the view so that cases are ordered, by the modified on
   field, from newer to older

Once this is saved, it should show as an additional view in the inbox on
Workspaces. This can take some time to load.

## Summary

The inbox is a useful tool for agents allowing them to manage their workload
with a single screen. We can customise views in the inbox to help agents to
quickly view and prioritise their workload.
